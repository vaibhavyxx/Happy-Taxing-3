# Happy-Taxing-3
Developed a game using Unity with C# to teach children and young adults about finances to make them responsible adults. Inspired by Club Penguin and Moshi Monsters' idea of making a stimulation-based game where users can customize themselves through shopping, work a job or do challenges to earn money.

It is an MVP version of the game, but we plan to add mini games withing stores, work places and bank to make it more fun for users.
